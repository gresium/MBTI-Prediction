# MBTI Personality Type Prediction
This project applies machine learning and data analysis to classify individuals into MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality types based on behavioral or textual data. It explores how AI can understand personality traits through language and data-driven modeling.

# Overview
The goal is to predict one of the 16 MBTI personality types (e.g., INFP, ENTJ) using text or survey data.
The notebook includes:
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature extraction (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, etc.)
Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or other classifiers)
Accuracy and insights visualization

# Technologies Used
Python 3
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
scikit-learn
NLTK or spaCy (for text preprocessing)
Jupyter Notebook

# How It Works
Load Dataset: MBTI dataset with user posts and corresponding personality types.
Preprocess Text: Clean, tokenize, and remove stop words.
Vectorize: Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
Train Model: Fit ML algorithms to predict personality type.
Evaluate: Measure performance with metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
Use Cases
Personality classification from social media data
Chatbot personality modeling
HR and psychology data analysis
Future Improvements
Use deep learning (LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy
Add visual personality dashboards
Integrate with APIs for live predictions
